## 🦝 Meet Fasoolya

Fasoolya is your in-app buddy who keeps an eye on your household inventory, notices when essentials are trending toward "uh oh," and helps you restock before it turns into a last-minute scramble. No nagging. No blame. Just the right nudge at the right time.

## ✨ What sNAKr Does

- Tracks **shared household inventory** for fridge + pantry
- Uses **fuzzy stock states**: `Plenty`, `OK`, `Low`, `Almost out`, `Out`
- Ingests **receipts (photo or PDF)** so inventory stays fresh with minimal effort
- Flags **shortages early** with simple, explainable prediction
- Builds a **restock list** so essentials don't sneak up on you
- Designed as a **Nimbly satellite** for smarter restocking decisions later

---

## 🌱 Why It Exists

Households are busy. Groceries are expensive. Food waste is ridiculous.

Most inventory apps either overwhelm you or expect perfect data. And once multiple people share a kitchen, everything gets messy.

sNAKr exists to help everyday people:
- Waste less without trying so hard
- Avoid duplicate buys and surprise shortages
- Keep the household in sync with minimal effort

Small signals. Real relief.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** ([Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- **Node.js 18+** (for Supabase CLI)
- **Git** for version control

### Get Running in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/sakialabs/snakr.git
cd snakr

# 2. Set up Supabase (local development)
./scripts/setup-supabase.sh  # macOS/Linux
# or
.\scripts\setup-supabase.ps1  # Windows

# 3. Configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub minimum)
./scripts/setup/configure-oauth.sh  # macOS/Linux
# or
.\scripts\setup\configure-oauth.ps1  # Windows

# 4. Start all services
./scripts/dev/start-all.sh  # macOS/Linux
# or
.\scripts\dev\start-all.ps1  # Windows
```

**Full setup guide:** See [docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md) for detailed instructions including OAuth configuration.

### Access Your Services

- **Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:54323
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs (coming soon)
- **Web App**: http://localhost:3000 (coming soon)
- **Database**: localhost:54322 (Supabase PostgreSQL)

### Verify Everything's Running

```bash
# Check Supabase services
supabase status

# Check Docker services
docker-compose ps
```

You should see all Supabase services running (API, DB, Studio, Auth, Storage, etc.)
