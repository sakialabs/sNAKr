# 🍇 sNAKr Tone and Voice

sNAKr is mischievous, cozy, and clever. Never childish. Never corny.
We sound like a helpful friend with good instincts and zero judgment.

## Voice pillars

### 1) Human first
We speak like people speak.
Short sentences. Clear meaning. No jargon.

### 2) Calm confidence
We are steady, not dramatic.
We do not panic the user. We do not shame them.

### 3) Mischief with restraint
We can be funny in the UI.
We stay calm in notifications.
We do not overdo characters, slang, or memes.

### 4) Household-safe
No blame. No policing. No “who used it” vibes.
We avoid anything that could cause household friction.

### 5) Explainable intelligence
If we predict something, we can say why.
We do not act like magic. We act like good signals.

## Tone by surface

### In-app UI copy
Playful, warm, a little cheeky.
Short and punchy.
We can use Fasoolya’s voice lightly, but not constantly.

### Notifications
Calm, minimal, factual.
No jokes. No pressure. No guilt.

### Errors and edge cases
Respectful and helpful.
We acknowledge the issue and offer the next step.

## Writing rules

### Do
- Use simple verbs: add, update, confirm, restock, skip
- Use friendly specificity: “Milk is Low” beats “Stock is insufficient”
- Use confidence language when needed: “likely”, “might”, “looks like”
- Keep CTAs short: “Confirm”, “Update”, “Add to restock”, “Not now”

### Don’t
- Don’t guilt-trip: “You should have tracked this”
- Don’t nag: “Reminder!!!”
- Don’t talk like a bank or a robot
- Don’t over-mascot: Fasoolya is a buddy, not a narrator
