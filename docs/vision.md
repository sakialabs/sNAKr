# 🍇 sNAKr Vision, Mission, Manifesto

sNAKr is a shared-household inventory brain in the Nimbly universe.  
It helps people stay stocked, waste less, and move through everyday life with less stress and more steadiness.

---

## Vision

A world where everyday essentials are handled calmly, locally, and with dignity.

Where households do not waste food, money, or energy just to keep the fridge running.  
Where technology reduces friction instead of adding chores.  
Where “smart” means human-first, transparent, and built for real life.

---

## Mission

Build open, local-first inventory intelligence that helps households:

- stay stocked without perfect tracking  
- reduce waste through early, explainable signals  
- coordinate shared living with zero blame  
- restock smarter by connecting to Nimbly and the wider ecosystem  

sNAKr turns receipts, tiny actions, and future device signals into one clear outcome:  
**a steady home.**

## Manifesto

### 1) We keep it human
Fuzzy states beat fake precision.  
If people need a spreadsheet, we failed.

### 2) We do not shame
No guilt. No nagging. No drama.  
Life is already heavy.

### 3) Households are a commons
A shared kitchen is a shared system.  
We build for cooperation, not policing.

### 4) We prevent waste on purpose
Waste is the enemy: money, food, time, attention.  
sNAKr exists to stop the quiet bleed.

### 5) We stay explainable
Predictions must be understandable.  
Confidence must be visible.  
Automation must be earned.

### 6) We are local-first by design
Resilience means nearby options, practical swaps, and steadier habits.  
Not “cheapest at any cost.”

### 7) We are open-source on purpose
This is grassroots infrastructure.  
Auditable. Forkable. Adaptable.  
A tool people can shape, not a black box that shapes people.

### 8) We build the bridge to action
sNAKr is awareness.  
Nimbly is the move.  
Together: fewer surprises, better timing, more breathing room.

## Short version

**Stay stocked. Waste less. Keep it human.**
